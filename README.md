### Idea
We are trying to design a website with a few minigames.
### Visual thoughts
Have a bar on top with a home page, about page, and a drop down bar. The top bar will also have a pause/play button for the game that is being played.

### Organizing with Bootstrap
To list our games, the top bar will have a drop down menu. This menu wil have the lists of all of our games; dino game, pong, minesweeper, tictactoe, and snakegame.

### Individual Scoring
Ethan: 4/4
Re'em: 4/4
Leo: 4/4
Zach: 4/4
